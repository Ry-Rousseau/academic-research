**3. Measurement and Data**
We now turn to the empirical data to test our argument. Details about the operationalization of all
our variables and summary statistics are shown in Appendix A.
We first consider the stake of critical supporters in asset price stabilization due to their mandatory
exposure to DC schemes or PFs. We identify the presence of mandatory DC schemes and PFs
in country crisis-years using the Social Policies Around the World (SPAW) dataset (Knutsen and
Rasmussen 2018) and supplement it with other sources (Association 2017; Pension Supervisors 2017).
Knutsen and Rasmussen (2018) use the SPAW data to examine differences in pension coverage
between autocracies and democracies. They find that schemes in autocratic regimes are more likely
to be targeted to fewer major occupational and social groups than in democracies. This, they argue,
reflects the incentive of regimes with smaller winning coalitions – autocracies – to provide resources
to a select group of critical supporters. Building on their logic, Figure 2 shows that mandatory DC/PF
schemes resemble other pension scheme designs in autocratic regimes – such as social insurance and

non-contributory schemes – in that they cover and target a significantly lower proportion of major
occupational and social groups than pension schemes in democracies. In fact, in autocratic regimes,
mandatory DC/PF schemes cover an even lower proportion of occupational and social groups than
other pension schemes.^13 What matters for regime survival is that financial crises threaten the
pension wealth of these critical supporters stored in market-traded assets.

3.1 Which financial crises?
In recent years, researchers have invested heavily in the construction of databases and chronologies
of banking crises. To ensure that we investigate crises of a similar magnitude in our empirical
analysis, we focus on “systemic” banking crises (SBCs). These are deep crises in which there are
severe losses and insolvencies in the banking system – the 1981-83 Chilean case is one example.
Especially in recent decades, they are increasingly associated with multiple policy interventions
aimed at mitigating their consequences (Laeven and Valencia 2013, 5). To date systemic crises, we
rely on the Metrick and Schmelzing (M&S) (2021) dataset, which provides the most comprehensive
coverage of banking crises since antiquity.
```
**3.2 Policy responses**
We draw on previous conceptual frameworks (Chwieroth and Walter 2019; Rosas 2006) that map
policy responses to banking crises along a continuum that ranges from no government intervention
(the _Market_ pole) to full socialization of all losses (the _Socialization_ pole). Policy responses typically
fall between between these two ideal types, cohering around what have been called “Bagehot” and
“Bailout” policy models respectively.
Following Walter Bagehot’s (1873) doctrine of crisis resolution, a Bagehot policy model extends
emergency lending to prevent illiquid but ordinarily solvent banks from failing, thus diverging

(^13) Appendix figure A.4 presents proportion of major occupational and social groups covered by pension across autocratic

somewhat from the pure Market pole.^14 These lender of last resort (LOLR) facilities are ideally
unlimited in size but require recipient banks to offer good “collateral”, and entail a “penalty” rate of
interest to ensure that the government is not subsidizing solvent banks. The general orientation of the
Bagehot model seeks to minimize taxpayer exposure by placing the burden of permanent insolvency
on banks, their shareholders and their creditors. Thus, it is best seen as a modified market-based
approach. It promotes the closure of insolvent banks, forces the recognition of losses on the balance
sheets of banks, and facilitates private sector recapitalization and involvement.
The Bailout model is closer to the Socialization pole because it involves the extensive use of
taxpayer resources to avoid the closure of some insolvent banks. These interventions typically entail
some bank closures and private sector losses, which differentiates the Bailout model from pure
socialization. Ultimately, what separates the Bagehot and Bailout models are the intention and target
of policy support and the probability of taxpayer losses, which is significantly greater in the latter.
Thus, we focus only on microeconomic policy interventions that map on to the Bagehot-Bailout
continuum, drawing on the M&S classification of policy responses into six main areas: Lending,
Guarantees, Capital Injections, Asset Management, Restructuring, and Rules.^15 We also follow
M&S in considering “No Intervention”, in which the authorities deliberately abstain from market
interventions, allowing markets to determine which banks survive.
Table 1 summarizes for each case the response that authorities pursuing a coherent Bagehot
or Bailout strategy would implement. The leftmost column lists the main policy areas. The inner
two columns describe the orientation of policy measures consistent with each policy strategy. The
rightmost column outlines how we make use of the M&S data to create binary indicators capturing
use of particular kinds of policy response.^16
We turn first to the raw data, which include crisis start dates from 1802 to 2014. We begin by
comparing responses in autocracies by pension arrangement. We identify autocracies using updated
data from Boix, Miller and Rosato (2014), which codes political regime types from 1800 to 2020.
Our sample contains policy responses to 216 crises in 90 autocracies: 118 crises occur in 27
autocracies in the pre-World War II era and 98 crises occur in 74 autocracies in the post-World War
II era. There were 20 crises in 15 autocracies where mandatory DC schemes and PFs were present,
all in the post-World War II era. Across all years and in the post-World War II sample, we observe
evidence suggestive of differences in the orientation of the policy response in autocracies by pension
type.
Figure 3 shows the relative frequency of each policy response indicator in the full sample and the
post-World War II era. We see that among autocracies with mandatory DC schemes and PFs, Capital
Injection, Liquidity support that departs from Bagehot’s dictum, and Resolution have been the three
most frequently deployed policy responses. This is followed by Guarantees and Asset Management.
Policy measures that avoid taxpayer exposure – Rules and No Intervention – are exceptionally rare in
autocracies with mandatory DC schemes and PFs. The strong orientation toward loss socialization in
autocracies with DC/PF schemes contrasts sharply with the policy orientation in autocracies where
these schemes are absent.
We use principal component analysis to create a single dimensional indicator that captures
correlations and dimensionality in the raw data. Our _Bailout Policy Index_ is constructed from the first
principal component, which is the linear combination of the seven indicators that explains the most

(^14) The emphasis on solvency “in ordinary times” indicates that there is necessarily some uncertainty about solvency during
crises, increasing the prospect of taxpayer losses (see Goodhart 1999, 347-352).
(^15) We exclude M&S’s “Other” category, which includes very different interventions including “stress testing,” “major
communication event,” and “other intervention types”. This heterogeneous set of interventions is small in frequency and does
not easily map on to the Bagehot-Bailout continuum.
(^16) For Lending, the M&S data capture the presence of liquidity support, but they do not permit us to identify when such
support departs from Bagehot’s rule. Accordingly, we supplement the M&S dataset with data from Chwieroth and Walter
(2019) to identify cases where liquidity support was uncollateralized, carried an interest-rate subsidy, or was provided to
applicants that were likely insolvent.

variance in the index itself. The _Bailout Policy Index_ has a mean of -0.37 (sd 1.32) and ranges from
-1.96 to 3.96, with higher (lower) values indicating a more coherent Bailout (Bagehot) response.
DC schemes and PFs are relatively modern social policies, introduced in the post-World War
II era in the countries in our sample.^17 The rising incidence of SBCs puts at risk the significant
wealth accumulated in these pension schemes by critical regime supporters. Using the _Bailout Policy
Index_ , Figure 4 plots the five-year average policy response and the number of SBCs for autocracies
by pension arrangement since 1800. It indicates that bailout interventions were rare before 1945,
but have become increasingly common since the 1990s. There is a notably stronger rising tendency
towards more extensive bailouts in autocracies with DC schemes and PFs.^18
Figure 5 plots the average orientations of policy responses where these schemes were present and
absent for the full sample and for the post-World War II era. It shows that autocratic regimes with
mandatory DC schemes and PFs typically implement significantly more extensive bailouts. This
response contrasts sharply with the decidedly more Bagehot-oriented policies typically implemented
in autocratic regimes where these pension arrangements are absent. We also find no significant
differences between the policy orientation of countries with mandatory DC schemes and those
with PFs. This pattern of policy tendencies is consistent with our argument that autocratic regimes
implement bailouts when financial crises put at risk the wealth of their critical supporters stored in
mandatory DC schemes and PFs.
Other factors could shape policy responses in autocratic regimes, including political institutions,
fiscal constraints, exchange rate regimes, and country-specific historical factors. We thus turn to
multivariate analysis. We use the _Bailout Policy Index_ as our dependent variable, employing ordinary
least squares to estimate government policy responses to banking crises and including robust standard
errors with country clusters.
Missing values pose significant concerns for our analysis, especially since banking crises are
relatively rare events. Inclusion of all the relevant covariates discussed below depletes the already

small number of observations. We adopt two strategies to address this issue. First, we estimate
reduced-form and more comprehensive specifications when using the complete case sample. Second,
we perform multiple imputation of missing values using MIDAS (2022) to avoid excluding banking
crises due to missing values in some covariates.^19

**3.3 Alternative Explanations and Control Variables**
Our main argument is that mass wealth held in mandatory DC/PF schemes will influence crisis
policy responses in autocratic regimes. Other forms of mass wealth, including housing assets and
domestic deposits, as well as leverage, have been shown to shape policy responses in democracies, as
has prolonged experience with effective government commitments to financial stability (Chwieroth
and Walter 2019). We thus consider measures of residential property prices, home ownership rates,
domestic deposits, household mortgage and consumer debt, and a measure of each government’s
track record of effective commitment to financial stability. However, we expect that in autocracies,
pension assets in DC schemes and PFs are likely to be more politically salient for the reasons provided
above.
As noted earlier, prior work views bailouts in autocracies as driven primarily by cronyist ties
between governments and elites (Johnson and Mitton 2003; Rosas 2006). Measuring the degree of
cronyist ties between governments and elites is difficult, so we employ several indicators that provide
a reasonable approximation of these ties. One is V-Dem’s clientelism index, which captures the extent
to which regimes offer material resources to certain groups in exchange for their political support.
We also consider four different V-Dem measures of corruption on the grounds that cronyist ties are
likely to be stronger in regimes with more corruption. Lastly, to tap into exchange relationships
between politicians, bankers, and corporate elites, we consider measures of bank loans to firms, bank
assets, and bank loans to the private non-financial sector.
Other important contributions have focused on the impact of variations in institutional structures
and political support coalitions on economic policy outcomes in autocracies (MacIntyre 2003;
Pepinsky 2009; Rosas 2006). For example, electoral autocracies and autocratic regimes in which

mass political parties are prominent could be more likely than other autocratic regimes to undertake
bailouts that protect mass wealth. Accordingly, we consider measures capturing the presence of
electoral autocracy and party-based regimes.^20 We also include the Polity dataset measure for degree
of democracy because regimes with some elements of democratic institutions may better represent
taxpayer interests and inhibit cronyism (Rosas 2006). We incorporate the natural log of per capita
GDP and public debt burdens to address potential fiscal constraints on the capacity of governments
to afford bailouts. Fixed exchange rates, which we capture using a binary variable, may also constrain
governments from undertaking bailouts (Oatley 1999). We also consider a measure of partisanship.
Finally, we employ time period dummies to account for unmeasured factors that evolve over time
but are constant across countries.
Due to the high level of missingness, our measures of public debt burden and partisanship are
not included in the reduced-form specifications for the complete case model specifications. The
remaining control variables appear in all model specifications.
Our empirical model is thus:

**4. Multivariate Results**
Our argument suggests that autocratic regimes with mandatory DC schemes or PFs should provide
more extensive bailouts during crises. The results, which appear in Table 2, show that household
exposure to mandatory DC schemes or PFs has a statistically and substantively significant positive
effect on bailout propensity in all model specifications. The coefficient on the mandatory DC/PF
indicator is of similar magnitude across both reduced-form specifications (M1 and M3) as well as the
full controls specification using multiply-imputed data (M4). The coefficient is largest in the full
controls specification using complete cases (M2), though the sample size is considerably smaller due
to missing data.
    Using results from M4, we find that when compared to an autocratic regime where such schemes
are absent, we would expect an autocratic regime with a mandatory DC scheme or PF to implement
interventions that are 1.23 points higher on the _Bailout Policy Index_. This is a large effect, roughly
equivalent to an increase of one standard deviation in our dependent variable.
    This substantive impact can be observed across time and across countries. Illustrative of this
shift over time are the contrasting policy responses of military-dominated governments in Chile to
severe banking crises in 1926, 1976 and 1981, the last occurring just after the introduction of its DC
pension scheme. The policy responses to these three crises are measured on our _Bailout Policy Index_
at -1.96, 1.11, and 2.09 respectively. In the first crisis, the authorities largely stood aside – a common
policy stance in this era. In the second crisis, the state guaranteed deposits when the mortgage system
became insolvent and a number of banks failed. After the introduction of Chile’s DC pension scheme
in 1980, the last crisis saw the most extensive bailouts, when 22 banks and financial institutions were
nationalized and the state issued deposit guarantees and guarantees for a wider range of liabilities.
    More recently, comparing across countries, there is a sharp contrast between the non-interventionist
approach of the Venezuelan authorities during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 (-1.96 on the
_Bailout Policy Index_ ) on the one hand, and that of the Russian (2.09) and Nigerian (2.21) authorities on
the other, who provided guarantees and capital injections. Both of the latter two countries had DC
pension schemes; Venezuela had no funded scheme. In addition, Nigeria set up an asset management
company, while Russia delivered liquidity support that departed from Bagehot’s rule.
    We also find no evidence that the effect of DC/PF schemes is merely capturing the presence
of a middle or urban class or is conditional on its interests, proxied by levels of urbanization and
tertiary education (Appendix table A.7).^21 In addition, we fail to uncover robust evidence supporting
alternative explanations based on other forms of mass wealth financialization, including housing
(Appendix table A.8).
One possibility is that the presence of DC/PF schemes is simply proxying for fiscal resources that
regimes use to provide cronyist bailouts. However, we fail to find robust evidence that the effect of
DC/PF schemes is merely capturing or is conditional on cronyist government-corporate linkages.
Nor is it conditional on party-based or electoral autocratic regimes (Appendix tables A.9,A.10, A.11,
and A.12). We also find the effect of DC/PF schemes holds _net_ of our measures of fiscal capacity:
GDP per capita and public debt burden. This result is more consistent with our argument about
the survival imperatives that autocratic regimes face when severe crises put at risk the accumulated
pension wealth of critical mass supporters.
    Lastly, our results are also robust to consideration of alternative samples of autocracies in V-Dem
and Polity (Appendix table A.13), and to the inclusion of IMF conditionality, capital account openness,
and spatial weights capturing policy diffusion via competition and learning (Appendix tables A.14 and
A.15) as additional control variables that are potential constraints on government policy responses.

(^21) We also considered V-Dem measures of middle class support, but these offer insufficient variation.

**5. Causal Mechanisms**

Having linked more extensive bailouts with citizen exposure to mandatory DC schemes and PF
pension arrangements, we now turn to supplementary tests of our argument to assess the causal
mechanisms at work. Our claim is that autocratic governments implement more extensive bailouts
in the context of mandatory DC schemes and PFs, in part to secure their survival.
To assess this claim, we use two outcome variables that capture incidents of mass mobilization
and unrest following policy interventions during a crisis. We draw on data from the Cross National
Time Series Archive (CNTS) (Banks and Wilson 2024) and from the Mass Mobilization Data Project
(MM) (Clark and Regan 2016), which explore mass mobilization events with a broad set of claims
over the most comprehensive samples. The CNTS data, which covers 1815 to 2023, provide a count
of the number of anti-government demonstrations, general strikes, and riots in a given year, while
the MM data, which covers 1990 to 2020, offer a count of the number of a broad set of protest actions
in a given year.
The scope conditions for our argument lead us to focus on countries where citizens are exposed
to mandatory DC schemes and PFs and where we expect crisis bailouts to reduce unrest. We would
not expect to find similar effects for more extensive bailouts in countries where mandatory DC
schemes and PFs are absent.
Using these two subsets of countries, we consider indicators of unrest across a time horizon that
includes all years specified in the crisis and policy intervention chronologies of the M&S dataset
as well as the year that follows.^22 We use country fixed-effects negative binominal regressions of
the CNTS and MM data on the _Bailout Policy Index_ , controlling for degree of democracy, GDP
per capita, and economic growth. We also include measures of empowerment rights and physical
integrity rights to account for the possibility that autocrats in DC/PF countries might repress more
to limit social unrest during crises. We account for the potential confounding effects of time trends
by including a cubic polynomial of time, and include a lagged dependent variable to address the
dynamics of the data-generating process.^23
Our empirical model is thus:

(^22) Crisis chronologies may be single or multi-year. For example, the crisis chronology for Malaysia, discussed further below,
includes observations for 1997 and 1998. Our time horizon for Malaysia thus includes 1997, 1998 and 1999. In cases of
follow-up crises, where the one-year post-crisis intervention horizon overlaps with a new crisis, the window for the previous
crisis ends in the year preceding the follow-up crisis.
(^23) We are not able to analyze whether policy interventions during a crisis affects regime survival in countries with mandatory
DC schemes and PFs, as there has only been two regime breakdowns under these conditions (Nigeria in 1993 and Zambia in
1996). Appendix table A.6 provides summary statistics.
